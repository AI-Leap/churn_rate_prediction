# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn**

## Project Description
This is the project to predict churn rate of user using bank data.
We are using two machine learning algorithms
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest
to classify the user.

This is concept to show the difference between data scientist and machine learning engineer.
The data scientist works with churn_notebook.ipynb. They experiment and build models using jupyter notebooks.
The machine learning engineer converts the code from notebook to production level code.
The churn_libray.py is produced by the machine learning engineer.

This is Test Driven. See churn_script_logging_and_tests.py for unit testing.

## Running Files
run the churn_library.py with
```
ipython churn_libray.py
```
This will produce the data exploration images, model results and models in respective folders.

run the test with
```
ipython churn_script_logging_and_tests.py
```
This will output the logs in logs folder. See the logs for test results.
